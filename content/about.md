My name is Marley and this is my personal site where I try to commit to learning in public, and blog about my interests. I live in Portland, OR and work as an Economist for a local consulting firm. I am primarily interested in the intersection of data science and the built environment. I also really like movies and I am trying to get better at explaining why.
